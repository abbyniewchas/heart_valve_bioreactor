# heart_valve_bioreactor
This github repo contains the CAD and software for our capstone's bioreactor

# Designs
The CAD for all designed components are included in this folder. Details of how to adjust the processing chamber's parameters are given in our group's capstone design report (CDR).

# Software
The software has been broken up into Arduino code and MATLAB code. The Arduino code is what runs on our system's arduino in order to run the bioreactor. The only file that should be changed in this folder is the .ino file that is actually flashed onto the Arduino board. The MATLAB folder contains files for data analysis and as well as code and simulink models that are useful for control design.
